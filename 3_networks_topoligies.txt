NETWORKS TOPOLOGIES

> Topology - a scheme (graph) how computers are connected into a network

Basic topoligies:
1. Mesh
    [+] There's a direct way to each computer
    [-] Requires many wires
2. Star
    - The central device is not a computer, it's a network device like switch, hub, router
3. Ring
4. Tree
5. Bus
6. Hybrid
    - Is always used in practice

> Physical topology - how devices are connected
VS
> Logical topology - the rules how devices transfer their signals

! Physical and Logical topologies can differ, i.e. 
    - Classical Ethernet: Physical - ring (the central device is switch),       Logical - bus
    - Switched Ethernet:  Physical - ring (the central device is also switch),  Logical - mesh
=> the only difference is in the central switch that makes different logic

Wi-Fi doesn't have a physical topology at all
