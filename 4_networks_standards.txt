NETWORK STANDARDS

! There were no standards in 60-70s. Only devices of the same developer could have worked together. The problem was solved by standartisation.

Standard types:
1. De jure  - made by eligible organisation
2. De facto - established by themself


Main standards:
1. ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
    - Made the reference how open networks should be built
2. IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
    - Makes standards for data transfer technologies and devices
3. IAB (Internet Architecture Board)
    - Makes standards for the Internet protocols 
4. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
    - Makes standards for WWW


IEEE is splitted into commitees: networks commitee is 802. That's why all our standards numbers are beggining with "802.", i.e.
- 802.3  Ethernet
- 802.11 Wi-Fi
- 802.15 BlueTooth
- 802.16 WiMAX


IAB is splitted into 3 parts:
1. IEFT (Internet Engeneering Task Force)
    - Makes standards for network protocols
2. RFC (Request for comments)
    - Makes documents with description of protocols made up by IEFT
3. IRTF (Internet Research Task Force)
    - Does research

! Every RFC has a number and describes one network protocol. i.e.
- RFC 793  - TCP
- RFC 791  - IP
- RFC 826  - ARP
- RFC 792  - ICMP
- RFC 2131 - DHCP
