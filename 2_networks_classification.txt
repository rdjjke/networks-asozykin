NETWORKS CLASSIFICATION

# By type
1. Packed-switched
    - Is used in computer networks
    - Data is splitted into packets
    - Reliable: can survive a node failure
    - Every node should solve the same "Routing problem"
    - Require more resources - some connection must be made every time
2. Circuit-switched
    - Is used in phone networks
    - Continious flow of data
    - Not-reliable: all nodes in the route must work properly

! Circuit-switched phone networks won't be examined in this course



# By transmission technology
1. Broadcast
    - Entered data is available for all computers
    - i.e. Classical Ethernet, Wi-Fi
2. Point-to-Point
    - Data is transfering from one computer to another (sometimes through a chain of intermediate ones)
    - i.e. Switched Ethernet



# By Size
1. Personal         1m          On desk             i.e. Bluetooth
2. Local            10m-1km     Room, building      i.e. Ethernet, Wi-Fi
3. Municipal        10km        City                Municipal networks that provide one connection with all Internet, TV, Phone
4. Global           100-1000km  Country, continent  In Russia, such networks are made by Rostelekom / Transtelekom
5. Networks joint   10000km     Whole world         i.e. Internet (TCP/IP)

! Local and Networks joint networks will be examined in this course
