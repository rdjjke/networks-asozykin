NETWORKING BASICS

# Difficulties
- Many different devices
- Reliability
- You must think in advance, because networks must be able to evolve
- Limited resources distribution between users
- There are trade-offs such as Quallity VS Speed
- Security
=> It's very difficult to design a network

! Networks are built using the "decomposition" method: the whole system is splitted into "layers".

Every layer:
- Uses a lower layer
- Provide a service to a higher level

This system has such pros:
- Single responsibility principle
- Isolation between not-neighbour layers - so less dependencies

> Service - what the layer do, its functions
> Interface - what operations lower level provides to higher
> Protocol - rules for how Nth level from one computer communicates with Nth level from another

! Protocol and Interface are different

Interface:
- Real communication inside a computer
VS
Protocol:
- Virtual communication with a remote layer through the interface of the lower layer
- Physical layer is the only layer that communicates in real
- !!! This communication between the same layers is carried out through "Headers"

> Architecture - describes a set of layers and protocols of a network. Interfaces are not included
> Protocol stack - an ordered set of protocols sufficient for communication through the network

! There are 2 popular standard models (protocol stacks):
1. ISO OSI
    - a law standard
    - includes 7 layers without specific protocols
    - good theoretical model
    - ! Isn't used in practice
2. TCP/IP
    - De facto standard
    - 4 layers
    - Widely used in practice

> Encapsulation - a principle of including a message of the higher level to the lower level
